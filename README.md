Create a basic node application using `npm init`. Add an `app.js` file. This is your entry point. Install express using `npm install express --save`.

Set up a basic route to serve an `index.html` file on the route `/`. Also set up basic file serving using `express.static` using a folder called "static". Put a client side JavaScript file named `scripts.js` in your static folder and a style sheet named `styles.css`. Add a script tag referencing your script your index.html file. Also add a link to your style sheet.

Next, make a folder called "modules". Copy your three module files from the `prime_peer_nd_00` assignment into this folder and require them in your `app.js` file.

Set up a new route on "/balance" that will use the required files to send a random account balance to the client. Use `$.ajax` to display this on the page. 

Add a button that will get a make a new Ajax call to the server, and display the new random balance on the page.
